Files:
-----
eem.bib: the main bibliography file - all entries should go here
bst/*.bst:	bibliography styles

Checking the validity of the bibliography entries:
-------------------------------------------------
A pdf file of the bibliography is produced by the command "make",
which produces "bib.pdf" from bib.tex and eem.bib. The bibliographic
style is determined by the next-to-last line of bib.tex:
\bibliographystyle{plain}
Instead of "plain" you can use "aiaa" or "mdpi" or any other
that has a .bst file in this directory

Like the rest of LaTeX, documentation of BibTex can be viewed
with "texdoc btxdoc"
